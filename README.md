# Application-of-Classification-Models-on-APS-dataset

This study aims to develop a predictive model for heavy vehicle air pressure system failure by comparing the performance of classification methods. The objective is to enhance safety and efficiency by identifying the best classification method, enabling proactive measures to prevent failures and reduce misclassification costs. Using a publicly available dataset from Scania trucks, we address the challenges of missing values and imbalanced class problems to optimize prediction performance. The results of this project will provide valuable insights for stakeholders to make informed decisions, ensuring the safe and efficient operation of heavy vehicles.
